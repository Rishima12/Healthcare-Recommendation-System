# Healthcare-Recommendation-System
A system predicting a healthcare score for an individual based on which they can be recommended healthcare plans.
Healthcare recommendation systems are valuable tools that assist individuals in making informed decisions regarding their healthcare plans and treatment options. These systems leverage deep learning models to analyze diverse healthcare data sources and provide personalized recommendations. This report outlines the development of a healthcare recommendation system, focusing on deep learning models, data integration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
A healthcare recommendation system relies on diverse datasets to make informed predictions.As suggested in the task,I have used The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES),that has following datasets and is readily available,
Demographic Data: Information about patients' age, gender, and location.
Diet Data: Dietary habits, nutrition intake, and dietary restrictions.
Examination Data: Results of medical examinations, vital signs, and physical assessments.
Labs Data: Laboratory test results, including blood tests and medical imaging.
Medications Data: Information about prescribed medications, dosage, and usage.
Another dataset,called the questionnaire was also availabe,however I for my project did not find it much useful,hence I used the above mentioned datasets,which are henceforth attached in this repository.
My models and approach required a labeled dataset to predict the healthcare score,however no labeled dataset was available hence I created my own synthetic labeled dataset as attached in this repository.
Implemenation: Data Integration and Preprocessing
Data integration is a crucial step in building a comprehensive healthcare dataset. It involves merging multiple datasets using a common identifier, such as patient ID. Preprocessing includes the following steps:
Handling Missing Data: Addressing missing values by imputation or removal.
Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features for the recommendation model.
Data Splitting: Separating data into training, validation, and test sets.
For the purpose of feature selection I used only the first three columns,which were sequence number and some other medical diagnostic details,since each of the dataset had around 30 columns(except medication),merged them and dropped the nan values.
The choice of deep learning model depends on the nature of the healthcare recommendation task. Common architectures include:
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): Simple and effective for tabular data.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Suitable for image-based medical data.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Useful for sequential data like time-series patient records.
Hybrid Models: Combining multiple architectures for a more comprehensive understanding.
I have trained the datasets and models on two architectures as listed above,one is the basic and most used(tabular datas) feedforward neural network and the other is the convolutional neural network which is mostly used for medical data that is image based.
Training deep learning models for healthcare recommendation involves:
Loss Function: Choosing an appropriate loss function (e.g., MSE, MAE) for regression or classification tasks.
Optimization: Selecting an optimizer (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) to update model weights during training.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of hidden layers.
In both the models that I trained,I have used above features.For feedforward network I have used mean-absolute-error as the loss function,where two dense layers(hidden layers) are used having RELU and LINEAR as the activation functions respectively.The output ayer also has the LINEAR as the activation function.Adam optimizer has been used and test loss has been hence calculated for 10 epochs or iterations of the network.
In the CNN model I have used mean-squared-error as the loss function,RELU has been used for input layer and dense layer and linear activation function for output layer.Again adam optimizer is used and prediction as well as loss is calculated.
The inputs have been kept same for both the models to judge the accuracy and determine which model is better.Since the labeled dataset is synthetic and is not according to the medical diagnosis and is random hence the prediction scores vary from the actual scores,however they are very close to each other in both the models and since the second model,which is feedforward neural network shows less total error,I find it to be more suitable for the healthcare recommendation.
The batch size and epochs have been kept 32 and 10 respectively because of the huge amount of entries in the dataset and since the whole project has been tried and tested on google colaboratory,it was difficult to run many epochs.
The repository has attached code in main file and the datasets,the code can be easily run on any google collaboratory,just the paths to the datasets will have to be changed while loading them.

A healthcare recommendation system using deep learning models can provide valuable insights and benefits for both healthcare providers and patients. Here are some key insights that I gained from this task,

Personalized Healthcare Plans: The system can analyze a patient's demographic, dietary, examination, laboratory, and medication data to create personalized healthcare plans. This ensures that individuals receive treatment and recommendations tailored to their specific needs, increasing the effectiveness of healthcare interventions.
Early Detection of Health Issues: By continuously monitoring and analyzing patient data, the system can detect subtle changes or anomalies in health parameters. This early detection can lead to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.
Treatment Effectiveness: Healthcare providers can use the system to assess the effectiveness of prescribed medications and treatments. By tracking patient progress over time, the system can provide insights into which treatments are most beneficial for specific conditions.
Preventive Care: The system can offer preventive care recommendations based on a patient's health history and risk factors. This includes advice on lifestyle changes, screenings, and vaccinations to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.
Cost Reduction: For healthcare payers and insurance providers, the system can help in optimizing healthcare costs. By recommending cost-effective treatments and interventions, it can contribute to more efficient healthcare spending.
Data-Driven Decision-Making: Healthcare professionals can make data-driven decisions regarding patient care. They can access patient profiles, treatment histories, and recommendations generated by the system to make informed choices about diagnostics and treatments.
Improved Patient Engagement: Patients become more engaged in their own healthcare when they receive personalized recommendations. They are more likely to adhere to treatment plans and make positive lifestyle changes when they see the direct benefits of these actions.
Research and Insights: Aggregated and anonymized data from the system can be used for medical research and epidemiological studies. Researchers can gain insights into population health trends, disease prevalence, and the effectiveness of various healthcare interventions.
Resource Allocation: Hospitals and healthcare organizations can use the system to allocate resources efficiently. For example, they can predict patient admissions and allocate staff and facilities accordingly.
Ethical Considerations: Insights into ethical considerations, such as data privacy and algorithmic fairness, can be gained from the system's design and implementation. Ensuring that patient data is protected and that recommendations are unbiased is critical.
Continuous Learning: The system can adapt and improve over time by continuously learning from new patient data and outcomes. This ensures that recommendations remain up-to-date and relevant.
Patient Outcomes Tracking: Healthcare providers can track the long-term outcomes of patients who have followed the recommendations generated by the system. This helps in assessing the real-world impact of the system on patient health.
